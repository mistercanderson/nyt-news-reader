# New York Times News Reader ðŸ‘“ ðŸ“–

## Overview

Check out the deployed page [here](https://nyt-news-reader.surge.sh/)

This app uses the NYT Top Stories API to give users a quick glance at current popular articles. When a headline is clicked, details from that story are displayed, along with a link to read the full story on the New York Times website.

Developed for a take home technical challenge, the work on this app was strictly timeboxed to 6 hours. Building this app was an exercise in developing an MVP with a limited amount of time.
